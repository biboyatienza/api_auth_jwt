# API Authentication with JWT

My take on an Authentication API using JWT (Access Token & Refresh Token) that you can use as base of your new project. 


## What we are be using
- Node.js 
- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB
- **Mongoose** for storing Users in Database.
- **Redis** for storing Refresh Tokens, also as validation and blacklisting at the same time.
